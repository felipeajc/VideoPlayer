# VideoPlayer
A list video player using Exoplayer 2 in Android.

About Language:<br>
The main language of the project is <b>Kotlin</b><br>
<br>

About Architecture and Libraries<br><br>
The project has a MVP Architecture. The Dagger 2 for dependency injector.<br>
Retrofit to get json data from the server and Gson to parse it. <br>
RX Java for composing asynchronous tasks using observable.<br>
Glide to loading and caching thumbnails.<br>
And, of course, ExoPlayer 2 to loading and showing the videos. <br>
I choose to do in MVP because is more easy for me to integrate with the Exoplayer component, that it is created in runtime.<br>
<br>

To run the project just clone or download the project, open it in Android Studio and execute for the device or emulator.
