# VideoPlayer
A list video player using Exoplayer 2 in Android.

About Language:
The main language this project is Kotlin.

About Architecture and Libraries
The project has a MVP Architecture. The Dagger 2 for dependency injector.
Retrofit to get json data from the server and Gson to parse it. 
RX Java for composing asynchronous tasks using observable.
Glide to loading and caching thumbnails.
And, of course, ExoPlayer 2 to loading and showing the videos. 
I choose to do in MVP because is more easy for me to integrate with the Exoplayer component, that it is created in runtime.

Run the Project
To run the project just clone or download the project, open it in Android Studio and execute for the device or emulator.
